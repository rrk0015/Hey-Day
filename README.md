# Hey-Day

Auburn University has a tradition called the Hey Day that is celebrated annually. What started off as a way to recognize students who served in the WWII, has not become a way of encouraging the Auburn family to greet each other.

If you see another Auburn affiliate, stop and say **"Hey"** with a smile.

Or forward this script to someone you are unable to meet in-person, and let the script do the talking!
